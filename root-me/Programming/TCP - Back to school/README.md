5 pts
# Description
To start this test using the TCP protocol, you need to connect to a program on a network socket.

 > Calculate the square root of number 1 and multiply by number 2.
 > Then round the result to two decimal places.
 > You have 2 seconds to send the correct answer from the moment the program sends you the calculation.

# Solution
I firstly started connecting to the server and tried receiving its message, I found out that every time I connected, it gave me a random number to calculate. Because I only had 2 seconds to submit my result of calculation to obtain the flag, I put another part in my script in order to do math calculation.
