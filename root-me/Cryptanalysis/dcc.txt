I found a clue to retrieve the password in the information of Dumping cached domain

ROOTME.LOCAL/Administrator:15a57c279ebdfea574ad1ff91eb6ef0c:Administrator

To solve this, I used John The Ripper in Kali. Firstly, make a file contains the content of admin's password hashes

echo 'Administrator:15a57c279ebdfea574ad1ff91eb6ef0c' >> mscash

Then, use John command like bellow

john --format=mscash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt mscash

*Note: Before run the command, you need to decompress to have rockyou.txt in /usr/share/wordlists
