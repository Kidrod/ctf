# Description
How about trying to match a regular expression
# Solution
I inspected the source code of the given website and found a javascript function responsible for sending user input to the server.

```javascript
<script>
	function send_request() {
		let val = document.getElementById("name").value;
		// ^p.....F!?
		fetch(`/flag?input=${val}`)
			.then(res => res.text())
			.then(res => {
				const res_json = JSON.parse(res);
				alert(res_json.flag)
				return false;
			})
		return false;
	}

</script>
```

I noticed a commented line containing a regular expression, it described the exact format of a valid input. The string must start with the character `p`, followed by exactly 5 arbitrary characters, and end with F!?

Based on this pattern, I constructed a valid input `picoCTF!?`

After submitting this input, the server validated it successfully and returned the flag, which was displayed in the pop-up.
