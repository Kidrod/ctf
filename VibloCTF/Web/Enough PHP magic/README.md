# Challenge: Enough PHP magic
200 PTS
# Description
If you guess my secret, i will give you flag!!
# Solution
This challenge welcomed me by a line mentioning me try guessing secret to get flag. I found some vuls here but it saying about PHP, I was considering about PHP type juggling 
loose comparison.

I had spent a while to try putting possible payloads to exploit PHP type juggling but no luck.

I thought need to change to another way, this website maybe running by PHP, therefore, I go to search on /index.phps to find anything interesting there.
