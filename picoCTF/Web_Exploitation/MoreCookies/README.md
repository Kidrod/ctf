# Solution
This challenge is an upgrade from Cookies; when accessing the link and searching for cookie, I decode it and obtain gibberish.

After researching some write-up, to solve this challenge,  need to use bit-flipping techniques on CBC ciphertext. Cookie may have information to authenticate for admin, something like admin=1, just flip 1 bit I can set the correct cookie.

Because I don't know where a bit that can change the authentication. So write a [script](solve.py) to brute-force it.
