# Solution
Follow hints, I use DevTools in Chrome to check source code of web and find something interesting in html file.

<img src='./media/4767.png' alt='A part of flag in html file' />

Get 1/3 of the flag. The rest are in css and js file. Link them to a string and I have the flag.

The flag is: **********
