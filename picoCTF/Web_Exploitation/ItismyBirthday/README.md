# Description
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website.
# Solution
Carefully reading the discription, I understand that I have to find 2 different PDF file but have the same MD5. 

Because of the length of MD5 algorithm, just 16 hexadecimal characters. Each character has 16 possible values, so there are only 16^32 different MD5 hashes. Look good but it still have some collisions.

Not difficult 2 file like that. I use [md5-1.pdf](./md5-1.pdf) and [md5-2.pdf](./md5-2.pdf) which are from [this repo](https://github.com/corkami/collisions/tree/master/examples/free)

Upload them and I can see a PHP script that contains the flag at the ending.

The flag is: picoCTF{*********************}
