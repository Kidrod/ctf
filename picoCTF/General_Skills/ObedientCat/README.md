# Description
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). [Download flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/33996e32dce022205a6a36f69aba56f0/flag).
# Solution 
The file is provided has no extension but it's not important, I just want to read it to get the flag.

In terminal I use **cat** command to read it. 

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop]
└─$ cat flag
picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_2aa22101}
```

The flag is: picoCTF{**********}
